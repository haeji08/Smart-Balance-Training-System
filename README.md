## Background
Balance is essential for basic movements such as walking in daily life. However, patients or elderly individuals with impaired balance often have difficulty maintaining their posture and frequently fall over, leading to discomfort and inconvenience.

## Details
We have developed a balance training system for patients and elderly individuals who need to improve their sense of balance using a rehabilitation device, the balance board.

### Key Features of Our System
1. **Real-Time Visual and Auditory Feedback**\
By integrating an Arduino and pressure sensors into a standard balance board, our system calculates the user’s center of gravity in real time. Based on this data, it provides immediate visual feedback (LED indicators) and auditory feedback (app notifications) to help users correct their posture instantly.

2. **Training Session Statistics and Reports**\
The system analyzes data collected from sensors and provides feedback through the app, enabling users to monitor their rehabilitation progress independently.

3. **Weekly Performance Analysis**\
By analyzing key performance indicators from weekly training reports, users can intuitively track their progress and stay motivated over time.
